I'm a French sys[ops,admin,engineer] currently living in Melbourne, Australia. This is where I talk about my experiences in software delivery, managing infrastructure and other things I learnt along the way.

Some posts  will be of a technical nature, some much less so.

This platform is powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and a customised [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) framework, with additional scripts by [Eric Jones](http://erjjones.github.io/).
