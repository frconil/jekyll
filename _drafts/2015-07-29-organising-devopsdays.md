I was one of the organisers for DevopsDays Melbourne this year, and it was definitely a great experience. Thanks to the sponsors, my fellow co-organisers, my company for giving me some time to make this happen, and of course everyone that came, we had a blast of a time!

I'm going to write up a quick recap of this event's ~~learnings~~ lessons.

For starters, as for many many many many other things, it's working just fine on the macro level, and not so well on the micro level. Without going into details (that's not our goal here), you find that things work well globally, but you have to deal with (very minor) individual incidents. Think of it as losing a cluster member in a medium-large cluster. Not the end of the world, just annoying when it happens.

So first lesson learnt: Just relax, it's going to be fine.

A thing that served me well was, surprisingly, some past experience as a writer. I applied the concept of the "story outline" to the tasks I had at hand with good results:
You take the main points that are really important, use them as anchors and keep them loosely attached to each other. From there you start to fill out until you're happy with the end result, even if it means swapping parts in and out, or moving them around.
In our case, we knew the when, how many, and the kind of setup we wanted. It was really helpful since you inevitably have to deal with compromises, change things here and there, but you keep a clear image of what is important for the conference to work, and you can sort and decide on venues by having a clear set of criterias.

Second lesson learnt: Know what you won't compromise on, and what has some wiggle room.
Second lesson learnt(b): Use previous, unrelated, experiences to make your job easier.

At some point, people will try your patience, on purpose or not. They will be co-organisers, attendees, sponsors, venue personel, anyone really.
If you're not comfortable with something or someone, or if you don't know, it's okay to pass the buck to someone else. That's why you're in a team.
Remember also that you can be equally trying when you refuse to budge, or are not sure what it is exactly that you need or want. You can't blame anyone for trying, really.
Third lesson learnt: sometimes you'll have to roll with it, you won't get your way with everything. It's not "MeAndMyselfDays", it's "DevopsDays".
