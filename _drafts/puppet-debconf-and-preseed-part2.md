The problem with automated installs is that sometimes you need to answer to some questions. Now you can have static preseed files that do that for you, but sometimes you want them to be not so static.

We have an issue where a specific package needs very specific things, one of them being access to a mysql server. And the root mysql password for said server. ("only" the root mysql password, mind you.)

Now we could just create a quick preseeded install for this, whack in a default password (which would be more or less secure) and go on our merry way, but it would be... regrettable if one of those credentials were to be compromised. More so if someone tries every host for ports responding to sql queries. 

So you generate random mysql passwords but then you need to keep rack of them, maybe go on each machine and run the package manually.

Or you can have a non-static preseed file generated by puppet, that uses the same randomly generated password you used for the mysql install.

Your file would look like this:

{% highlight ruby %}

{% highlight %}
